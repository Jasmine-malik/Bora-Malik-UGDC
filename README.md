# Bora-Malik-UGDC
what makes me unique?
I believe that what makes me unique is my experiences. Everyone have different experiences. My experience shapes me to be unique from self-learning Mandarin Chinese to tutoring multiple groups of kids and living with only my grandparents.
Why did I join ugdc?
I joined this club because I want to be able to experience creating something new that me and other people can learn from and enjoy.
